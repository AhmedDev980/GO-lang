# GO-lang

*static type:
If we enter the data type in a wrong way and it throws error.
a=5,b=10
a+b=15
a=5,b=one
a+b=error

*Dynamic type:
If we enter a data type in different way still it will pick up. It is a compile lang.
a=5,b=10
a+b=15
a=5,b=one
a+b=5one


* Integers
It can be declared as int(Both + and - ) and uint ( only + )
* String
It can be declared as string. What ever declared in " " will be taken as string even numbers also.
* Boolean
It can be decalred as bool.
* Float
It can be declared as float32 or float64.

* Variable declaration
If we hard coded string like name:= "bangalore" then output will be bangalore and again if we overlap the existing string with another string then name = "chennai" then output will be chennai. But if we overlap the string with int then it will throw error. For ex if we give name = 123 instead of name = "chennai" then it will throw error.

* Conversion Data Types.
This is used to convert the datatypes and it is called "TYPE CASTING" . For EX: STRING TO INT and INT to STRING etc.
For this we will use the package called strconv package.

* OPERATORS
  1. COMPARISION OPERATORS
     1. EQUAL TO ( == )
     2. NOT EQUAL TO ( != )
     3. LESS ( < )
     4. LESS THAN EQUAL ( <= )
     5. GREATER ( > )
     6. GREATER THAN EQUAL ( >= )
  2. ARITHMATIC OPERATORS
     1. ADDITION ( + )
     2. SUBTRACTION ( - )
     3. MULTIPLICATION ( * )
     4. DIVISION ( / )
     5. MODULUS ( % )
     6. INCREMENT ( ++ )
     7. DECREMENT ( -- )
  3. LOGICAL OPERATORS
     1. AND ( && )
     2. OR ( || )
     3. NOT ( ! )
