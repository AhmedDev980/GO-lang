* Variable declaration
If we hard coded string like name:= "bangalore" then output will be bangalore and again if we overlap the existing string with another string then name = "chennai" then output will be chennai. But if we overlap the string with int then it will throw error. For ex if we give name = 123 instead of name = "chennai" then it will throw error.
